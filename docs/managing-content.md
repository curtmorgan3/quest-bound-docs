# Managing Content

All content in Quest Bound is stored on your computer directly through your browser. You can import and export Quest Bound data
as files, many of which may optionally be opened in separate applications and managed there.

## Import Rulesets

You can import rulesets as zip files directly from the rulesets page.

There is a similar import button on most pages, including attributes, items, actions and charts.

Importing a ruleset will fail if you have that ruleset already, so you must first delete the existing one if you want to replace it.

Alternatively, content may be imported individually to rulesets. Doing so will import additively, letting you add content without replacing it.

## Export Rulesets

Export your ruleset as a zip file from the ruleset settings page. The zip file includes a README with meta data, directories with all the images
and PDF documents used in the ruleset, as well as `.tsv` files for managing attributes, items, actions and charts in a spreadsheet application like Google Sheets
or Microsoft Excel.

## Characters

Characters are created from rulesets. When a character is opened, you may build its character sheet from the set of windows available in its ruleset.
