# Documents

RPGs often have additional resources beyond the rulebook which serve as references for players during gameplay. You may create documents in your ruleset by uploading PDFs, which
can then be referenced directly from character sheets.

## Additional References

Any document added to your ruleset will be accessible from a character's homepage by selecting "Documents" from the sidebar.

This will populate the table of contents with a selectable list.

:::tip
It is highly recommended that you include a PDF version of the rulebook in any ruleset you publish. Players are more likely to purchase content in
digital formats if it is sold alongside a downloadable file.

Published rulesets which include a PDF rulebook are marked with a special indicator on their marketplace pages.

## Using a Document in the Rulebook

A single document may be assigned to a ruleset's rulebook. Doing so will allow you to use any page of that document
as a component in the page editor.

These components work like all others. They may be styled, scaled and arranged individually. By layering components on top of the
document component, you can make edits and additions to the page.

## Automatic Rulebook Generation

Quest Bound can create an entire rulebook for you from a document. After assigning a document to a rulebook, an option to create pages
from that document will appear.

When selected, Quest Bound will create a new rulebook page for each page of the document. These pages will have a single document component, set to
fill the entire page by default.

:::info
Quest Bound will title each generated rulebook page based on the largest text on the page in the PDF. Depending on how the PDF is formatted,
this might not always make sense. Each page title can be edited after its creation just like normal rulebook pages.
