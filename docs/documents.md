# Documents

Documents are PDF files that you can attach to your ruleset for players to reference. They're perfect for rulebooks, quick reference guides, character creation instructions, and any other written content.

## What are Documents?

Documents allow you to include PDF files in your ruleset that players can view while playing. This is useful for:

- **Rulebooks** - Full game rules and mechanics
- **Quick reference sheets** - Combat rules, spell lists, condition effects
- **Character creation guides** - Step-by-step instructions for making characters
- **Lore and worldbuilding** - Setting information, maps, histories
- **Supplemental content** - Additional rules, optional systems, expansions

## Creating Documents

To create a document:

1. Navigate to the Documents page in your ruleset
2. Click the "New" button
3. Provide a title, description, and optional category
4. Upload a cover image (optional but recommended)
5. Upload a PDF file
6. Click "Create"

### Document Properties

Each document has:

- **Title** - The name displayed to players
- **Description** - Brief explanation of the document's contents
- **Category** - Optional grouping (e.g., "Rules", "Lore", "Reference")
- **Cover Image** - Visual thumbnail to help identify the document
- **PDF File** - The actual document content

## Viewing Documents

### From the Ruleset

When editing a ruleset, you can view documents by:

1. Going to the Documents page
2. Clicking on any document card
3. The PDF viewer opens with the full document

### From Character Sheets

Players can access documents while viewing their characters:

1. Open a character
2. Click the documents icon in the sidebar
3. Browse available documents
4. Click to open and view

### Pinning Documents

Characters can pin frequently-referenced documents to their sidebar:

1. Open a document while viewing a character
2. Click the pin icon
3. The document remains in the sidebar for quick access during play

## PDF Viewer Features

The built-in PDF viewer includes:

- **Page navigation** - Browse through pages with next/previous buttons
- **Zoom controls** - Adjust the view size for readability
- **Download** - Save a copy of the PDF to your device
- **Search** - Find specific text within the document (browser-dependent)

## Document Categories

Organize documents into categories to help players find what they need:

- **Rules** - Core mechanics and systems
- **Reference** - Quick lookup tables and guides
- **Lore** - Setting information and stories
- **Character** - Creation and advancement guides
- **Supplemental** - Optional rules and expansions

Categories appear as filters on the documents page, making navigation easier.

## Best Practices

- **Use cover images** - Visual thumbnails help players identify documents quickly
- **Keep PDFs focused** - Break large rulebooks into smaller, topic-specific documents
- **Descriptive titles** - Clear names help players find what they need
- **Optimize file size** - Compress PDFs to improve loading times
- **Organize with categories** - Group related documents together
- **Include a "Quick Start"** - A brief getting-started guide for new players
- **Update regularly** - Keep documents current with your ruleset version

## Documents vs. Content Components

**Use Documents when:**

- You have existing PDF content
- You need multi-page formatted text
- You want players to download or print content
- Content is primarily reference material

**Use Content components (in windows) when:**

- Information should be visible on the character sheet
- Content is brief and specific to a character
- You want markdown formatting
- Information changes per character

## Exporting Documents

When you export a ruleset:

- All documents are included in a `documents/` folder
- PDF files are preserved with their original formatting
- Document metadata (title, description, category) is included
- Cover images are stored in the `images/` folder

This makes it easy to:

- Share complete rulesets with all reference materials
- Back up your content
- Transfer documents between rulesets
- Edit PDFs externally and re-import
