#### Quest Bound is a tabletop game engine.

You can use Quest Bound to help you create tabletop role playing games (TTRPGs), then share them with players.

## What does Quest Bound do?

With Quest Bound, you can create custom digital TTRPG rulesets. When you share your ruleset with another user, they can read your rulebook and create characters with interactive, digital character sheets.

As you continue to add content to your rulesets, owners of that ruleset can optionally update their copies with that content. They can also make their own edits, customizing your ruleset to their liking.

### Dynamic Rulebooks

Rulebook pages in Quest Bound can be crafted from scratch with a drag and drop visual editor. Rather than a single area of text, you can arrange and scale multiple rich text elements on a single page. You can drop images, text and shapes on top of these to place elements _anywhere_ with 1 pixel precision.

Rulebook pages in Quest Bound can read properties from your ruleset, filling in variables, tables and images automatically. It can even create entire pages for you based on templates you design.

### Interactive Character Sheets

When a player creates a character from your ruleset, they’ll select a sheet template you've designed. Sheets allow players to control their character's attributes like skills, health, stamina or whatever your ruleset needs. You define these attributes in your ruleset.

Often, attributes derive their value from other attributes through your ruleset's mechanics. With Quest Bound, you can build these automations directly into your sheet templates through a no code visual programming editor. Fields in character sheets will update automatically based on your rules.

### Modular Rulesets

Rulesets in Quest Bound are modular. You can expand your ruleset with a module that adds anything a ruleset has. Owners of both the ruleset and the module may add and remove the module to their copy like an expansion.

You can create modules for _any_ ruleset, not just the ones you created. Add your favorite home-brewed content to D&D Fifth Edition. That content will work seamlessly with the ruleset, even the sheet automations.
