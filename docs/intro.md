# What is Quest Bound?

If you want to make a website but aren’t familiar with web development, you might use a tool like Wix, Wordpress or Shopify to help. _These are website engines_.

If you’re making a video game and don’t want to start from scratch, you could use a tool like Unreal Engine or Unity. _These are video game engines_.

#### Quest Bound is a tabletop game engine.

You can use Quest Bound to help you create tabletop role playing games, then publish them for players to use.

## What does Quest Bound do?

With Quest Bound, you can create custom digital TTRPG rulesets. When you share your ruleset with another user, they can read your rulebook and create characters with interactive digital character sheets.

### Dynamic Rulebooks

The rulebook of a TTRPG is more than an explanation of mechanics. It’s a vessel for the visual style of your universe. Rulebook pages in Quest Bound can be crafted from scratch with a drag and drop visual editor. Rather than a single area of text, you can arrange and scale multiple rich text elements on a single page. You can drop images, text and shapes on top of these to place elements _anywhere_ with 1 pixel precision.

Rulebook pages in Quest Bound can read properties from your ruleset, filling in variables, tables and images automatically. It can even write entire pages for you based on templates you design.

### Interactive Character Sheets

When a player creates a character from your ruleset, they’ll select a sheet template you've designed. Sheets allow players to control their character's attributes like skills, health, stamina or whatever your ruleset needs. You define these attributes in your ruleset.

Often, attributes derive their value from other attributes through your rulesets mechanics. With Quest Bound, you can build these automations directly into your sheet templates through a no code visual programming editor. Fields in character sheets will update automatically based on your rules.

### Modular Rulesets

Rulesets in Quest Bound are modular. You can expand your ruleset with a module that adds anything a ruleset has.Owners of both the ruleset and the module may add and remove the module to their copy like an expansion.

You can create modules for _any_ ruleset, not just the ones you created. Add your favorite home-brewed content to D&D Fifth Edition. That content will work seamlessly with the ruleset, even the sheet automations.
