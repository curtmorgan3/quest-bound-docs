# What is Quest Bound?

## Tabletop Game Engine

If you want to make a website but aren’t familiar with web development, you might use a tool like Wix, Wordpress or Shopify.

_These are website engines_

If you’re making a video game but aren't skilled in computer programming, animation or 3D graphics, you could use a tool like Unreal Engine or Unity.

_These are video game engines_

#### Quest Bound is a tabletop game engine.

You use Quest Bound to

- Create your own tabletop role playing games (TTRPGs) and share them with players
- Create digital tooling for your existing TTRPGs that can partially automate your game

## What does Quest Bound do?

Quest Bound is a place to capture digital copies of your TTRPGs, called Rulesets. Within a ruleset, you can manage your content through charts,
documents and lists of attributes, items and actions.

You can make modular pieces of UI called windows and construct digital character sheets from them. Windows are designed through
a drag and drop editor, may reference content in your ruleset and be dynamic to a character's attributes.

From a ruleset, you can make characters that have their own character sheets and track their own inventories and attributes.

## Quest Bound is not a video game engine or virtual table top

While complex automation is completely possible in Quest Bound, it is not intended to replace the players or game master of a TTRPG. Use Quest Bound
to augment your play either at the table or through a VTT. Quest Bound does not play the game for you.
