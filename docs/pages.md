# Pages

Pages are sets of windows that serve as templates for a character sheet page. Each page defines which windows appear on it and where they are positioned. When a character uses a page, they get that pre-designed layout.

## What are Pages?

Pages sit between [windows](./windows.md) and character sheets. Windows are the building blocks—individual panels with components. Pages combine multiple windows into a layout that characters can use as a starting point for their sheet.

Think of it this way:

- **Windows** – The individual panels (stats, inventory, skills, etc.)
- **Pages** – Templates that arrange those windows on a canvas (e.g., "Combat" page with health, armor, and attack windows)
- **Character sheet** – The player's sheet, built from one or more of these page templates

## Creating Pages

To create a new page:

1. Navigate to the Pages tab in your ruleset
2. Click "New"
3. Give your page a label and optional category
4. The page editor opens where you add and position windows

## Page Editor

The page editor is a canvas where you design the layout. You add windows from your ruleset and position them by dragging.

### Adding Windows to a Page

1. Click "Add window" in the bottom toolbar
2. Search or browse the list of windows in your ruleset
3. Click a window to add it to the page
4. Drag the window to position it on the canvas

Each window can only appear once per page. Windows already on the page are disabled in the add dialog.

### Positioning Windows

- **Drag** windows to move them
- Positions are saved automatically
- The layout you create is the default layout characters get when they use this page

### Page Details

Click "Edit page" to configure:

- **Name** – The page label (e.g., "Combat", "Inventory")
- **Background image** – An optional image behind the windows
- **Background color** – A solid or semi-transparent color
- **Background opacity** – Controls how visible the background is (0–100%)

## Page Categories

Like windows, pages can have categories. Use categories to group related pages (e.g., "Core", "Combat", "Social") and to filter the page list when browsing.

## Pages and Characters

When a character is created, they can use pages from the ruleset. Each character page links to a ruleset page and inherits its layout—the same windows in the same positions. Players can still move windows on their character sheet, but they start with your designed layout.

See [Characters](./characters.md) for how players add and manage pages on their character sheets.

## Design Tips

- **Create windows first** – You need windows before you can add them to pages
- **Organize by purpose** – Use separate pages for different game phases (e.g., "Combat", "Downtime", "Character Creation")
- **Use backgrounds sparingly** – Background images add flavor but can make text harder to read; adjust opacity as needed
- **Test with a character** – Open a test character and add your pages to see how they look in use
