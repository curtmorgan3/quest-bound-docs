A legend or subject line that says: “DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice;”
Description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
A URL or a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Game Tools, the other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site;
Your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the alleged infringing material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed); and
Your electronic or physical signature.
The Company will only receive DMCA notices by mail, e-mail, or facsimile at the addresses below:

If you have additional questions you may telephone the Company at (206) 745-2859.

9.3.2 NOTICE ABOUT REPEAT INFRINGERS. Our intellectual property policy is to (i) remove or disable access to material that we believe in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or his or her agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Game Tools, any other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site; (ii) remove any Content posted to the Game Tools, any other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site by “repeat infringers”; and (iii) promptly terminate the accounts of users who are determined to be “repeat infringers.” We currently consider a “repeat infringer” to be any user for whom we have received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512 with respect to content submitted by such user. We have discretion, however, to terminate the account of any user after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon our own determination.

12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.

12.1 Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and the Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 16(b), you and the Company agree that every dispute arising in connection with this User Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this User Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this User Agreement.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

12.2 Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, nothing in this User Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

12.3 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and the Company will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) (collectively, “AAA Rules”), as modified by this User Agreement. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

12.4 Notice of Arbitration; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Company’s address for Notice is: 6501 Third Avenue NW, Apt. 402, Seattle, WA 98117​. The Notice of Arbitration must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.

12.5 Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with this User Agreement, the Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in King County, Washington, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

12.6 No Class Actions. EACH USER AGREES THAT USERS MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

12.7 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If the Company makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to the Company’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Company’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your Account with the Game Tools or other QUEST BOUND Services will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

12.8 Enforceability. If Section 12.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 12 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to this User Agreement.

13 Termination of User Agreement and of Use. Each user agrees that Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate or suspend this Agreement, and/or to terminate or suspend the user’s access or use of any Game Tools, any other QUEST BOUND Services, the Site, or any other Company IP Asset for any reason or no reason (including, without limitation, due to a breach of this User Agreement by such User) without notice or liability to you. Upon termination or suspension, regardless of the reasons therefore: (i) user’s right to access or use (including, without limitation, the user’s Access Right as defined herein) the Game Tools, any other QUEST BOUND Services, the Site or any other rights granted to user under this User Agreement will immediately ceases; and (ii) the Company has the right to demand that the user immediately delete all copies of the Game Tools and other QUEST BOUND Services in the user’s possession or control.

14. Changes to this User Agreement or any Game Tools, Other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site. The Company may, in its sole discretion, make changes, amendments, revisions or updates, at any time and from time to time, to any of the terms and condition in this User Agreement (including without limitation any Game Tools code of conduct as defined herein), or to any aspects of the Game Tools, any other QUEST BOUND Services, or the Site, including, without limitation, any Content, any activities available on the Game Tools, other QUEST BOUND Services or Site, or any products or services offered through the Game Tools, any other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Changes”). Company reserves the right to make these Changes by giving a notice that the Company deems reasonable, both in form and where such notice will be posted or sent, provided, however, the Company reserves the right not to give notice of such Changes to each individual user. A USER’S CONTINUED USE OF THE GAME TOOLS, ANY QUEST BOUND SERVICES, OR THIS SITE AFTER THE EFFECT DATE OF ANY SUCH CHANGE SHALL BE DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES. If you have any questions or concerns after reading this, please email Company at support@questbound.com.

15. Additional Provisions.

15.1 Indemnity. Upon a request by Company, each user hereby agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold the Company, its affiliates and other subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees, agents, business partners, licensors, licensees and other representatives harmless from any and all damages, liabilities, costs, claims, and expenses (including attorney’s fees) on account of any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding made or brought against any such party, or on account of the investigation, defense, or settlement thereof, arising out of, in connection with, or related to such User’s: (a) use, misuse or unpermitted use of the Game Tools, any other QUEST BOUND Services, the Site, QUEST BOUND Services Content, or any other Company IP Assets (b) infringement of any Trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, or other rights of the Company; (c) breach or violation of this Agreement; or (d) i infringement of any Trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, or any other rights, of any third party, including without limitation infringing any Trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by any third party in any User Third Party Content (as such term is defined in Section 5 herein). Company reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by any user under this provision, in which event the user will cooperate with Company in that action.

15.2 Applicable Law; Disputes.

15.2.1 This User Agreement, and any and all disputes, issues, controversies or matters arising from or related to this Agreement, any Game Tools, other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site, is governed by and construed exclusively in accordance with the laws and decisions of the State of Washington, without giving effect to its choice of law or conflict of law provisions.
15.2.2 Subject at all times to the application of, and the terms and conditions set forth in, Section 12 above ( Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) which shall govern all disputes between the parties, you agree that the state and federal courts sitting in Seattle, Washington will be the exclusive forum and situs for the resolution of any and all disputes, issues, controversies or matters (to the extent such disputes, issues, controversies or matters are not, or are no longer, subject to and governed by Section 12 herein) arising from or related to this User Agreement or any Game Tools, other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site, and that any such disputes, issues, controversies or matters must be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action. You hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in Seattle, Washington and service of process by certified mail. If any part of this provision is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion is construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the User Agreement, and the remaining portions remain in full force and effect.

15.3 Entire Agreement. This User Agreement, accepted by your first use of the Game Tools, any other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site, and further affirmed by creating an Account or submitting Content to any Game Tools, other QUEST BOUND Services or the Site, contains the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the subject matter of this User Agreement (including without limitation the use of all Game Tools, all other QUEST BOUND Services, and the Site) and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings of the parties with respect to that subject matter.

15.5 Remedies. Each user acknowledges and agrees that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized use of the Game Tools, any other QUEST BOUND Services, the Site or any other Company IP Assets, and therefore each user hereby agrees that Company shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court or arbitration panel of competent jurisdiction without necessity of posting a bond and without having to plead and prove lack of an adequate remedy at law.

15.6 Attorney Fees.

15.7 Binding Effect; No Assignment by Users; Permissible Assignment by Company.

Any purported assignment by a user in violation of this Section shall be void. Company shall have the right to assign this Agreement, or any part of it, in its sole discretion to any party, and all covenants and agreements hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by such successors and assigns.
