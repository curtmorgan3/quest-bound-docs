# Modules

Tabletop games are, above all else, about creativity. When you look at the rulesets on your shelf at home, chances are a few of them have loose leaf papers shoved into the back. Scrawled on these pages are the various custom monsters, items and races you’ve added to a universe created by someone else.

## Extending a Ruleset

When a ruleset is on your shelf in Quest Bound, it means you own a _copy_ of it. With that copy, you can make as many edits as you like. Anything you can do to a custom ruleset, you can do to your copy of a ruleset created by someone else. At any time, you can remove that ruleset from your shelf and add it again to get a fresh copy free of edits.

As a player of a TTRPG, this is probably enough customization. You can create new sheet templates, edit the description of attributes, make notes in the rulebook pages—all only visible to you.

When acting as the game master, however, you may want to share the edits you’ve made with other players so they can use _your_ sheet templates, read _your_ notes, etc.

## What can I share?

The only time you can directly share a ruleset on your shelf with another user is if you created it from scratch. That’s it.

You _might_ be able to share custom content of a ruleset you own but didn’t create if the ruleset creator allows it.

When a ruleset is published, the creator has an option to allow modules to be created for it. Modules are copies of rulesets that include custom content. If the creator allows it, modules may be published and shared just like rulesets. **Using modules requires that the original ruleset also be on your shelf!**

:::caution
When a module is added to a ruleset, existing content in that ruleset will not be replaced. Only content original to the module will be added. That means editing a ruleset’s content in a module will not have an effect when its added.

## Generic Modules

Modules don’t need to be created for a specific ruleset. Any ruleset created from scratch can be turned into a generic module.

Generic modules can be added to _any_ ruleset and are a great way to share boilerplate content at the genre level. They are also a great way to quickly automate sheet templates.

For example, you could create a generic module for fantasy games which includes ten character archetypes as well as their attributes. Any ruleset that adds this module will have all its content added to it, meaning those attributes and their logic can be referenced in the ruleset’s sheet templates.

Quest Bound includes several generic modules helpful for bootstrapping new rulesets.
