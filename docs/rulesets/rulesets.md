# Your Shelf

Imagine walking into your favorite gaming store with shelves of tabletop RPGs along the walls. You walk down the aisles until one catches your eye. After a quick skim through the first few pages, you buy the copy, take it home and place it on your shelf.

When you log into Quest Bound, you’ll see a list of all the rulesets you’ve created, purchased or which have been directly shared with you. **This is your shelf** and you can think of it exactly like the one you have at home.

You can browse your shelf, thumbing through all of your ruleset copies, but eventually you select one and open it. Once a ruleset is opened in Quest Bound, _everything_ you see is viewed within the context of that ruleset. It is the universe of a game and there can never be more than one open at a time.

:::info Your copy belongs to you
Just like buying a ruleset from the store and bringing it home, you’re free to do what you’d like with any ruleset on your shelf. Edit the pages, add archetypes, change the rules, redesign the sheet templates—changes you make to your ruleset will only be visible to you.

Read about [modules](./modules.md) to understand how to customize and extend rulesets on your shelf.

### Ruleset Entities

Rulesets are collections of several other entities. By themselves, rulesets don’t do much. Their purpose is to bind these entities into a package that you can share with others.

A ruleset is made of the following:

- [Attributes](../attributes/attributes.md)
  - The atoms of a ruleset. These are the variables that attach to all other entities
  - Stats like hit points, age, durability, skill and experience can all be represented as attributes
  - Can hold logic to automatically derive their value from other attributes
- [Archetypes](../archetypes.md)
  - Collections of attributes which can have variations specific to the archetype
  - The “category” of your ruleset's characters and creatures
- [Charts](../charts.md)
  - Data sets of tabular structure, like a spreadsheet
  - Charts can be referenced in attribute logic or directly added to rulebook pages
- [Sheet Templates](../sheet-templates.md)
  - Provides a template for character sheets
  - Sheet templates hold fields to control a character’s attributes
- [Rulebook](../rulebook.md)
  - Binds the rules of your ruleset into a digital book
  - Pages can be nested and linked together to emulate a wiki structure

## Publishing Rulesets

Before sharing or creating modules from a ruleset, it must first be published.

Publishing a ruleset creates an archive of that ruleset **as it exists at the moment of publication**. It is that archive that will be copied to user's shelves when they add it or create modules from it.

You can continue to make edits to your ruleset after publication. Those edits will not be available to others until you sync the updates.

:::caution
Once a ruleset has been published, it can not be unpublished.

When you sync updates to a published ruleset, any user who owns that ruleset can add it to their shelf again to recieve the updates.

To control access to supplemental content after publication, create modules for your ruleset and publish them individually. Alternatively, create new versions of your ruleset.
