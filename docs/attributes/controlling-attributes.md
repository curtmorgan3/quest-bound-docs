# Controlling Attributes In Game

When your players make a character from your game, that character gets a copy of every attribute in your ruleset. The player needs to be able to control those attributes, viewing and updating them for the lifetime of that character.

## Windows

When a player makes a character, they construct their own character sheet by adding windows from the ruleset. Each window can include
controls wired up to specific attributes.

### Controlling Attributes

Certain components have an option in their toolbar for attribute assignment. Components that are controlled by the player in game, like inputs and checkboxes, will let players control those attributes.

:::info
Boolean attributes may only be assigned to checkboxes. A check indicates a value of _true_, while unchecked represents _false_.

### Reading Attributes

Text and content components may also be assigned attributes. Unlike inputs and checkboxes, these components will only read attribute values, not update them.

Text components which are assigned an attribute will display its value.
