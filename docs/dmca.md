QUEST BOUND TECHNOLOGY, LLC
DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT POLICY
SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF THIS DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT POLICY
This Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy (this “Policy” or “DMCA Policy”) is set forth by Quest Bound Technology, LLC, a Washington limited liability company (“Company”, “We” , “Us” or “Our”) and governs the Company’s website at https://questbound.com (the “Company Website”), the Company’s Quest Bound game development tools or game engines ( “Game Tool(s)”), and any other website, mobile app, site, program, platform or services that are owned or operated by the Company (the Company Website, the Game Tools, and any such other websites, mobile apps, sites, programs, platforms or services are hereinafter collectively referred to as “Company Program(s)”).
REPORTING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT; NOTICE AND TAKEDOWN PROCEDURE UNDER THIS POLICY
It is the Company’s policy to expeditiously respond to clear and proper notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). This Policy describes the information that should be present in these notices to the Company. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to the Company as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify.

The form of notice of alleged infringement specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov).

It is expected that all users of any part of the Company Programs will comply with applicable copyright laws. However, if the Company receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement pursuant to this DMCA Policy, our response to these notices will include removing or disabling access to content or material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.

If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.
