# Quest Bound Documentation

Find the main Quest Bound repo [here](https://github.com/curtmorgan3/quest-bound).

## Requirements

You need to have Node in order to run the local server and see the site in your browser. You can follow the steps to do so [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

This is a static documentation site, so you can also read the Markdown files directly without running the server. All files are nested under `docs/`.

## Install and Build

Clone this repo. From the top directory, run

```
npm install && npm run build
```

## Run the Docs

Use this command to run the local server on port 3000.

```
npm run serve
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000/` to view documentation.
